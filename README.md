# wifi-glow
smart-light build using esp-idf and ESP32-C3 IC, with custom LED control driver

### Purpose 

This project is a pilot project to getting up to speed with ESP-IDF development framework,   

using ESP32-C3 development IC.

It features hardware design from scratch, using inbuilt ESP32-C3 features, e.g LED PWM control, GPIO Muxing etc.

### Driver development

A custom driver is written to be able to control the RGB, Warm white and Cool white LED systems.  Also, Wi-Fi control is implemented to be able to control the smart LED light remotely.
